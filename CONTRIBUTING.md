#### We welcome contributions, but please ensure that you read the following information before issuing a pull request. Also, refer to this document as a checklist before issuing your pull request. This will save time for everyone.

### How Can I Contribute?

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

The fairly standard procedure to contribute in GitHub is to creating a fork, do your work, issuing a pull request, and then allowing us time to review the changes and merge that pull request back into the original project.

1. **Fork**  the repo on GitHub
2. **Clone**  the project to your own machine
3. **Commit**  changes to your own branch
4. **Push**  your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a  **Pull request**  so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from &quot;upstream&quot; before making a pull request!

### **Creating a Fork**

Just head over to the GitHub page and click the &quot;Fork&quot; button. It&#39;s just that simple. Once you&#39;ve done that, you can use your favorite git client to clone your repo or just head straight to the command line.

Once you have successfully forked your repository, you will need to clone it locally to your machine.

### **Doing Your Work**

### Create a Branch

Whenever you begin work on a new feature or bugfix, it&#39;s important that you create a new branch. Not only is it proper git workflow, but it also keeps your changes organized and separated from the master branch so that you can easily submit and manage multiple pull requests for every task you complete.

Now, go to town hacking away and making whatever changes you want to.

### **Pull Requests**

Prior to submitting your pull request, you might want to do a few things to clean up your branch and make it as simple as possible for our team to test, accept, and merge your work. Once you&#39;ve committed and pushed all your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to GitHub. Your pull request will automatically track the changes on your development branch and update.

- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
- End files with a newline.
- Avoid 3rd Party Platform-Dependent code.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for AriesCMS. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

### **How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?**

Bugs are tracked as  [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you&#39;ve determined a bug exists on the project, create an issue on the repository and provide the following information:

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

-  Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
-  Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don&#39;t just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
-  Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you&#39;re providing snippets in the issue, use  [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
-  Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
-  Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
-  Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use  [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows.
-  If the problem is related to performance, include a performance report if possible.
-  If a specific action did not trigger the problem, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share as much information as possible.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

-  Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of AriesCMS) or was this always a problem?
-  If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of AriesCMS? What&#39;s the most recent version in which the problem doesn&#39;t happen? You can download older versions of AriesCMS from  [the releases page](https://github.com/paimanOne/AriesCMS_Beta1/releases).
-  Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
-  If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files),  does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some? Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

#### **How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?**

Enhancement suggestions are also tracked as  [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you&#39;ve determined your enhancement suggestions, create an issue on the repository and provide the following information:

-  Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
-  Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
-  Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as  [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
-  Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
-  Include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of AriesCMS which the suggestion is related to. You can use  [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows.
